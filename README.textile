*Flo's Open libRary*

This is a C++ core library that is used in several of my projects:
* "oclraster":https://github.com/a2flo/oclraster
* "a2elight":https://github.com/a2flo/a2elight
* "unibot":https://github.com/a2flo/unibot

*Requirements:*
* Windows: NT 6.0+ x86 (Vista/7/8/2008/2008R2/2012/2012R2); NT 5.1/5.2 x86 (XP/2003) support is uncertain
* OS X: 10.7+
* Linux: any x64 distribution that supports the AMD, Intel or Nvidia OpenCL SDK/drivers
* FreeBSD: 10.0+ (amd64; i386 support is uncertain)

*Build Instructions:*
* after cloning: git submodule init && git submodule update
* after a submodule update / pull: git submodule update

on Linux and FreeBSD:
* install all necessary libraries and programs, including clang 3.2+ and libc++ (currently 1101) (-> Credits)
** on "Arch Linux":https://www.archlinux.org (sub-dependencies are installed automatically): pacman -S clang libc++ sdl2 sdl2_image libxml2 premake freetype2 boost opencl-headers cuda
** any of: opencl-nvidia (in addition to Nvidia drivers), intel-opencl-sdk (from AUR, CPU only or in addition to Intel GPU drivers) or "catalyst":https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMD_Catalyst + "misc":https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMD_Catalyst#OpenCL_and_OpenGL_development
* run ./premake.sh or "./premake.sh pocl" on FreeBSD
* make
* there is an install script located in the top folder which should be executed from that folder (will install to /usr/local/)
* alternatively:
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/floor/bin/libfloor{,d}.{a,so} /usr/local/lib/
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/floor /usr/local/include/floor
* when using X11 forwarding, set these env variables:
** export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=yes
** export SDL_VIDEO_X11_NODIRECTCOLOR=yes

on Windows/MinGW:
* install custom MinGW builds "gcc-dw2-4.6":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-dw2-4.6-release/ and "clang-3.2":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/clang-3.2-release/ (thanks to "rubenvb":https://github.com/rubenvb for providing these!)
* install "MSYS":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/ to your MinGW folder
* build/install all necessary libraries, including libc++ (-> Credits; a2elight is not required/used, CUDA is optional)
* add a Windows system environment variable called "MINGW_ROOT" and set it to your MinGW root folder (e.g. "/c/mingw/mingw32/")
* add the "mingw/bin" path to the Windows system environment variable called "PATH"
* run "./premake.sh"
* make
* libraries and headers will be automatically installed to your previously set MinGW folder
* note: to make things easier, I might provide a full MinGW package containing all required libraries at a later point

on OS X:
* install Xcode 5.0+, Xquartz, SDL2, SDL2_image, CUDA (optionally) and boost (copying headers to /usr/local/include or /usr/include suffices)
* if you're using /Library/Frameworks:
** 10.8 SDK: ln -sf /Library /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/Library
** 10.9 SDK: ln -sf /Library /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/Library
* compile floor.xcodeproj
* install/symlink floor .dylib and lib folder:
** if /usr/local or any sub-folders do not exist, create them (sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{include,lib})
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/floor/bin/libfloor{,d}.dylib /usr/local/lib/
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/floor /usr/local/include/floor
* compile any samples you like

*Optional:*
In the future, there will be configuration options (defines) that can disable certain parts of floor that aren't wanted or needed (e.g. networking or OpenCL).
Right now, only CUDA support can disabled by not defining "FLOOR_CUDA_CL".
